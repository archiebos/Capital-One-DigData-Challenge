I gained work experience with Capital One completing an online challenge hosted by DigData.

The task was to create a model to predict customer spending habits which was then used to adivised Capital One to maximise profit.

Skills Developed:

- Understanding the importance of excluding any data which would result in skewness.
- Conducting a rigorous modelling process.
- How to split the data into test and train subsets to test the performance.
- Multiple statistical tests to find the best model.
- Using the model to reach business conculsions to help advise the company
